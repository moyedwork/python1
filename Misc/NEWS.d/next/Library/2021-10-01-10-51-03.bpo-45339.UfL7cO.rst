Currently the only way to use a custom thread class with the ThreadPoolExecutor is extend the class and override the private method _adjust_thread_count(), which means reproducing (basically, copying and pasting) the body of that method into application code. This change would allow the thread class to be specified when the ThreadPoolExecutor is instantiated, allowing for more composable use.
