Currently, subscripting a class object with a metaclass
that defines the :meth:`~object.__class_getitem__` method
would invoke the metaclass's method. This behavior is now deprecated
and will be removed in Python 3.16.
To make instances of a metaclass subscriptable,
define a :meth:`~object.__getitem__` method on the metaclass.
